        About: a website dedicated to piano playing. It will include tabs of songs, recent arrangements that have just been released (audio and video versions), and songs of the week. <br>

        Why is my website important: People will be able to keep up with all of their favorite artists recent releases with the sheet music. There are currently no webites that I know of dedicaded to spreading news of 
        modern piano players. People whill be able to keep up with their latest releases and learn the songs as well. <br>
        
        Target audience: younger piano players looking to listen to and learn versions of modern songs being played on the piano. <br>
        
        Content on each page: each page will include recent songs released, sheet music, links to youtube channels, links to social media accounts, upcoming shows. <br>
